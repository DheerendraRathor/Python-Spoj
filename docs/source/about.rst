About
=====

This project is a self motivated project and targeted for programmers who are active on `SPOJ <http://www.spoj.com>`_.

This project is built over following packages and modules:

* `click <http://click.pocoo.org/3/>`_
    Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary. It’s the “Command Line Interface Creation Kit”. It’s highly configurable but comes with sensible defaults out of the box.

* `mechanize <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mechanize/>`_
    Stateful programmatic web browsing, after Andy Lester's Perl module WWW::Mechanize.

* `beautifulsoup4 <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/>`_
    Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.
